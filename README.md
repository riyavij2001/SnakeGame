# Snake Game

This project is a classic Snake game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game brings back the nostalgia of the popular Snake game that was present on many early mobile phones. It challenges players to navigate a snake on a grid, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself.

The Snake game offers three levels of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. In the easy level, the snake moves at a slower speed, making it suitable for beginners or players who prefer a more relaxed pace. As the levels increase, the speed of the snake becomes progressively faster, adding an extra layer of challenge for experienced players.

One of the critical aspects of the game is the collision detection mechanism. If the snake bumps into itself, the game ends, and the player's final score is displayed. The game also keeps track of the highest score achieved, providing players with a goal to beat and compete against themselves or others.

## Features

-   Three levels: Choose between easy, medium, and hard levels, each with a different snake speed.
- Snake movement: Control the snake using arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
- Collision detection: The game ends if the snake collides with itself.
- High score: The game records and displays the highest score achieved.


## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used to create the structure and layout of the game.
- CSS: Used to style the game elements and provide visual effects.
